    "Ans : Multiprocessing in Python refers to the technique of utilizing multiple processes to execute tasks in parallel, taking advantage of modern multicore processors.

    "Multiprocessing :\n",
    "1. In multiprocessing, multiple processes are created, each with its own memory space and pythpn interpreter. Processes run independently of each other and can execute tasks concurrenlty.\n",
    "2. These processes are isolated from each other, means one process's memory generally won't affect others.\n",
    "3. Processes communicates through mechansims like pipes, queues, and shared memory. Synchronization is necessary to ensure data consistency and avoid race conditions.\n",

    "Multithreading :\n",
    "1. In Multiithreading, multiple threads are created within a single single process. Threads share same memory space and resources of the parent process.\n",
    "2. Threads with same process same memory space, which can lead to complex issues if not managed properly.\n",
    "3. Threads within a process share memory space, making communication  and synchronization between threads more stratightforward but also prone issues like race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
