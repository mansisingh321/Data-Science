    "Que 1 : What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program. Multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, thereby improving performance and responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Why is it used?\n",

    "4. isAlive() : The isAlive() method is used to check whether a thread is currently executing or alive. It returns a boolean value indicating the thread's execution status."

    "Ans : \n",
    "Deadlock :  A deadlock occurs in a multithreaded system when two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource that the other(s) holds. In other words, it's a situation where a group of threads/processes are blocked and cannot continue execution because they are all waiting for resources that are locked by other threads/processes in the same group.\n",

    "Race conditions : A race condition arises when two or more threads/processes access shared data concurrently, and at least one of them modifies the data. The outcome of the program becomes unpredictable because the order of execution and scheduling of threads/processes is not guaranteed.\n"
